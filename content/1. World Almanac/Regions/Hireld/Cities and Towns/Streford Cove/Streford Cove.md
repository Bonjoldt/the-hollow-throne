## Streford Cove

> (Description: Nestled along a rugged stretch of storm-battered coastline. Once a quiet fishing village, the strategic location of the cove perched on the only natural harbor for miles has forced it into prominence as the frontline in the outgoing conflict between the remnants of Valmere and the Jaspar forces. The cove itself is shaped like a crescent with steep cliffs embracing a shingle beach. )

- The houses surrounding the area show signs of patched up battle scars, hastily repaired walls, boarded windows, and signs bearing allegiance to either side.
- Markets and daily life continue to bustle even with the arrays of archers perched on the top of the coast. 
- During nightfall and foggy mornings, sometimes the blockading ships can be seen approaching the land, before narrowly turning back as day breaks.
