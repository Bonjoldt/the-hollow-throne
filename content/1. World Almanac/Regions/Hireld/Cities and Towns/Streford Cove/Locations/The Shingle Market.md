## The Shingle Market

> (Description: A haphazard sprawl of canvas awnings and makeshift stalls along the crescent beach just above the high-tide line. Here fishmongers compete with black marketeers selling contraband and hard-to-find goods: ammunition hidden among barrels of salted cod, coded messages passed with loaves of bread. )
