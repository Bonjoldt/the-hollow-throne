## Gull's Rest Inn

> (Description:A rambling, timber-framed building perched at the edge of the docks. Once a rowdy fisherman’s haunt, it now serves as neutral ground—a smoky, crowded refuge where off-duty soldiers, nervous traders, undercover spies, and anxious townsfolk mingle over watered ale. Deals are struck in shadowy corners; secret messages pass beneath mugs on sticky tables. )
