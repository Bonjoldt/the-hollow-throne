## Details

Rising from the dust and grit of its namesake quarry, Asphalt City is a bustling construction town built on industry and ambition. The very heart of the city is the vast Asphalt Quarryâ€”a sprawling pit of black stone and gravel whose deep caverns resound with the constant thunder of machinery. Many civilians tend to avoid the large quarry located in the center of the city over safety concerns.
