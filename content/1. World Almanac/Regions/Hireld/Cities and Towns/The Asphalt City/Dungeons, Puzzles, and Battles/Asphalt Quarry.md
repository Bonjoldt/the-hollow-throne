## Overview

- The Quarry is a multi layer structure that contains branching pathways and the sense of a maze-like expedition, almost impossible to traverse without a guide.
- Walking through the beginnings of the quarry outsiders are met by the workers of the Quarry, who are not used to outsiders. They use this opportunity to attempt to beg for money, freedom, and some even out of their misery. It's considered initiation for those wanting to see the insides of the quarry.
- The inner parts of the quarry are locked behind a mystic-like door, which can only be opened by a specific gold coin carried by those in charge of the quarry. 



### The Second Layer


- Inside the second layer is a few torches to light your way which have been enchanted to not burn out. There are many branching paths and caves escaping from the main one however they are not lit. It is explained this is a way to prevent the slaves from somehow escaping as they are unable to see in the dark. Venturing further into this layer the effects of the quarry's environment can start taking a toll on those descending due to them not being used to the sensation surrounding them.
- As our party ventures further, keen-eyed individuals will notice small glimmers of light erupting near the top of the cave, before quickly dissipating. This does not stop the party from venturing forward, reaching the next layer of limestone fairly quickly.


### The Third Layer

- The third layer is considerably darker than the previous ones. This is mostly due to the lack of ambient light, but also there is less oxygen to fuel the torches. Navigating without a guide is next to impossible this deep as the branching paths can reconvene and send players running around in circles. An ever darkness is present, even to those who are blessed with the ability to see in the night.
- If capable of passing through to the next layer, they will find themselves at the bottom of the quarry, where the Asphalt Oasis resides.


### Asphalt Oasis
- Located at the bottom of the level of the quarry, this location is not a typical oasis at all. Fully covered in stone and enchanted light, this cove is shaped more of a prison rather than a relaxation spot. It is said those who were sent to be tested by the Gods came here to be judged. Those who passed were gifted a means to return to the surface while others were subjected to a life of stone, joining the stone walls of the Quarry itself.
