**Name:** The Winking Satchel

**Location:** Down a narrow, cobblestone side street, wedged between a bakery and an herbalist.

**Exterior:** The shopfront is painted a cheerful teal, with battered wooden shutters and a sign depicting a leather satchel with one eye winking playfully.

**Interior:** Shelves groan under oddities, trinkets, potions, and tools. The air smells like cinnamon and old parchment. Rugs from distant lands cover creaky floorboards.

**Proprietor:**  
*Maribeth Tiller*, a nimble-fingered halfling in her early 60s. Her spectacles are always slipping down her nose as she haggles with customers or polishes baubles. She values stories as much as coins.

**Goods Available (sample):**
- Healing potions (standard & minor)
- Mysterious sealed scrolls (“No refunds!”)
- Bag of ball bearings
- Set of enchanted dice (roll twice on perception checks once per day)
- Used but sturdy thieves’ tools
- Lucky rabbit’s foot (grants +1 on one saving throw per week)
- Bundle of rare spices from distant kingdoms
- Local gossip or rumors (“If you’ve something interesting to trade…”)

**Barter Policy:**
Maribeth loves unusual items and tales. She often accepts:
- Interesting trinkets
- Well-told stories or songs
- Help moving heavy crates in the back room
- Fresh pastries from next door

**Notable NPC Encounter:**
*Old Jarn*, a grumpy dwarf regular, is arguing over the price of a “genuine troll toenail.” He might rope the party into settling the dispute—for a price.
