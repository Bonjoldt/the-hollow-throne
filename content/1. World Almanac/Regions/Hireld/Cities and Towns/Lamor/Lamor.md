## [[Lamor]]

> (Description: A small town that is the only settlement left standing on the western side of Hireld. Once nestled near the city of Arago, the conflict from the Kingdom of Jaspar left  the city in ruin. The town itself was saved from most of the devastation due to the city  shielding it from  the shoreline.  )

- The Old Mill located in the town was one of the main mills in the region that built most of the infrastructure in the surrounding area, but has not functioned for years.
- Residents of the nearby cities would often visit to get away from city life. Hosting parties, weddings, and gatherings quite frequently.
