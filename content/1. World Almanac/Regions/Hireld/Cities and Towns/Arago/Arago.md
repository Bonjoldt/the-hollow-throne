<i>(Location: [[Hireld]] )</i>

## Arago

> (Description: A once great city that rested on the western edge of Hireld. Known for their intellectual mages and strong cases of magic, the city used to be impenetrable due to the charms that once protected it. During the initial onslaught from Jaspar they managed to break through, destroying the city in the process. Now only ruins remain. )

- Used to be home to Everlore, the greatest mage college of the eastern islands before it's collapse. It is unknown what happened to it and it's arch mage.
