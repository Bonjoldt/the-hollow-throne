<i>(Location: [[Hireld]] )</i>

## Esterley Peaks

> (Description: A vast mountain range located in the center of Hireld. Consisting miles of land, the multitude of mountains make traversing difficult and is considered by some to be a death sentence due to the height of the mountains. Paths can be found along the ground, however it is quite easy to get lost. )

- Some say they can hear the sounds of soldiers losing their lives in battle through the echoes of the mountain range.
