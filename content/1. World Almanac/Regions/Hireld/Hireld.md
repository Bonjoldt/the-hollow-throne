<i>(Location: [[Eredurn]] )</i>

## Hireld Region

> (Description: One of the medium sized islands located in the center of Eredurn. Considered to be the last stronghold for the Valmere forces. Politics are widely influenced by the Wyrmling family located in Streford Cove, managing whatever resources they have due to the blockade by sea by Jaspars' forces. Due to the prolonged war efforts Hireld can be classified as the poorest nation in the world. )
